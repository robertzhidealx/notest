# Notest

## Setup

For the app to work, you need to create a `.env.local` file at the root directory and insert the following line:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

You can obtain your API key at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

You would also need to obtain the MongoDB URI and paste it in the env file in order to develop locally. **For those simply wanting to view the latest deployment, simply go to http://notest-hyper.vercel.app.**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
